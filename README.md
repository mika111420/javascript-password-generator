# Password Generator Starter Code

This weeks challenge was to create a randomized password generator based off of a users selected criteria following a series of prompts. The application has dynamic HTML & CSS that is powered by the JavaScript code written. The app runs in a browser, and has a responsive user interface. When the user clicks the "Generate Password button", the user is prompted first for the length of the password, to be no less than 8 characters and no more than 128, the user is then prompted to select inclusion of special characters, lowercase and uppercase characters, and numeric characters. The answers inputed by the user are validated and the password output is one that matches the selected criteria, and displayed in the generated box.
